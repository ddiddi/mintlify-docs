## Hardware Detection

Solo Server automatically detects your hardware configuration during setup:

```bash
solo setup
```

This command:
- Identifies your CPU model and cores
- Detects available GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, or Apple Silicon)
- Measures available memory
- Determines the optimal compute backend

## Backend Selection

Based on your hardware, Solo Server selects the most appropriate backend:

| Hardware Configuration | Recommended Backend | Notes |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM | vLLM | Best performance for large models |
| AMD GPU | vLLM with ROCm | Optimized for AMD hardware |
| Apple Silicon | vLLM ARM | Native support for M1/M2/M3 |
| CPU-only | Llama.cpp | Efficient CPU inference |
| Limited resources | Ollama | Lightweight and versatile |

## Automatic Configuration

The `solo serve` command automatically:
- Selects the appropriate Docker image for your hardware
- Configures memory allocation and compute settings
- Sets up the correct ports and networking
- Handles model quantization based on available resources

## Manual Override

You can override the automatic selection:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Force Ollama backend
  solo serve -s ollama
  ```

  ```bash Force vLLM backend
  solo serve -s vllm
  ```

  ```bash Force Llama.cpp backend
  solo serve -s llama.cpp
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Hardware Requirements

| Backend | Minimum Requirements | Recommended |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| vLLM | 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU with 4GB VRAM | 16GB RAM, NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM |
| Ollama | 4GB RAM | 8GB RAM, GPU for acceleration |
| Llama.cpp | 4GB RAM | 8GB RAM, CPU with AVX2 support |

<Tip>
  Solo Server will automatically select the most appropriate backend based on your hardware. You only need to manually override if you have specific requirements.
</Tip>

<Note>
  For optimal performance, ensure your system meets the recommended requirements for your chosen backend.
